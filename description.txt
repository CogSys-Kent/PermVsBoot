Use the permVsBoot.R script to test differences produced under the null hypothesis
for the peak to peak measurement applied to ERP's
The test creates noise EEG data sets and then calculates p-values, for the p2p measurement, generated using bootstrap and using permutation. The goal is to compare the distribution of p-values.
For the bootstrap: at each resampling a new ERP is generated for each condition, by selecting with replacement from the available trials (of each condition)and then p2p measurement is calculated. After all the resamplings the p-value is calculated as the proportion of the bootstrap values that are greater than 0
For the permutation: at each resampling a new ERP is generated for each condition, by randomly assigning trials to conditions, and the p2p is measured. A p-value is calculated as the proportion of permutation values that are greater than the true observed value (value of the original set).
The script saves the result to Rda and cdv file and produces a pdf image that compares the p-value distributions.

This is a pseudocode of how the p-values are calculated.
for each test (tests = 10000)
Steps:
1st-- Generate 2 EEG sets (first condition vs second condition)
	first condition i.e. (fc<-createnoiseeeg(trials,len,ns))
	sc<-createnoiseeeg(trials,len,ns)
	No difference between them 
2nd-- Generate 2 ERPS
	First condition ERP 
	Second Condition ERP
	Calculate p2p measurement for each one of these
	Save difference to be use as the true observed value for the permuation
3rd-- Start Resampling (number of resamplings = 1000)
	For each Resampling:
	  a)Generate bootstraped first condition by selecting with replacement from the set
		of trials of the first condition
		Generate boostraped second condition by selecting with replacement from the set 
		of trials of the second condition 
		Generate two ERPs  from the bootstraped EEGs 
		Calculate p2p on each ERP 
		Save the difference
	  b)Create two permuted condition by randomly choosing from the set of all available
	    trials. Generate two ERPs, calculate p2p and save difference
4th- END of one resampling
	  a)Calculate bootstrap p-value = 1- (number of bootstrapped differences greater 
	  									  than 0/ number of resampling )
	  b)Calculate permutation p-value = number of permuted differences greater than true
	  								    observed/ number of resampling
	  Go to Step 1
5th-- END of tests
       plot histogram of 10000 boostrapped p-values
       plot histogram of 10000 permuted p-values
